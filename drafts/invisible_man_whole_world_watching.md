Author: Nick Jones
Summary: This book is quite good

I recently read Mychal Denzel Smith's <i>Invisible Man, Got the Whole World Watching: A Young Black Man's Education</i> - it's the first book I've read that really ...the author being my age, experiencing current events with him...

Smith touches on quite a few topics - it's hard to really narrow it down. The book left me googling names (I admit to having not known how Claudette Colvin was), revisiting videos from growing up ([Kanye after Hurricane Katrina](https://youtu.be/zIUzLpO1kxI?t=14s) - also holy shit, this [Today Show interview](https://youtu.be/_cdlFd5-04E?t=2m39s) many years later is horrible), and thinking a lot harder about what Barack Obama's presidency meant to America as a whole.

I didn't want to frame this as much of a book review (short review: I loved it), but I did want to highlight some of the main points that Smith makes, and pull out quotes that really resonated with me. The book speaks for itself, so I'll skip trying to summarize it.

So many references to people / events that I grew up with - Kanye, Lebron, Ron Artest, Dave Chappelle

The kind of book that sends you off googling names, people, interviews.

## On Obama / his election
Smith touches here on something I've personally thought a lot about since Obama's presidency - many people in denial of racism's persistence today will point to the fact that we've had a black president. If we've had a black president, how could we possibly be a racist nation?

"Barack Obama governs a nation enlightened enough to send an African American to the White House, but not enlightened enough to accept a black man as its president."

> Obama’s election crystallized the American narrative of progress—one that locates racial injustice in the past and as the product of ignorance and hatred—telling us that things will always get better. And yet the country, and black people specifically, experienced record levels of incarceration and unprecedented economic inequality. The symbolism of Obama’s success became a cudgel against discussions of persistent racism in housing, education, and health care. And for the young people who showed up to the polls for the first time to put him into office, the limitations of having a black president gradually came to the fore.

> The compromise that needed to be made in order to help sell Obama was to not mention the Jena Six. Or criminalizing black youth. Or blackness more generally. Obama needed to be Michael Jordan: amazing and black without reminding anyone he was black. He had to run to become president of the United States, not president of Black America. His supporters had to understand this and do their part in the selling. The young, black, college-educated people who were at the forefront of the protests for the Jena Six and who later became Obama volunteers and voters turned their attention from racial justice activism to electing the first black president. Those are two different things, and only one results in a movement. But in Obama, there was hope.

There were a number of quotes that Smith pulls from Obama's speeches that frankly surprised me. I was not particularly politically aware for a long time - really up until a couple of years ago. There are a few points made here: 1. Don't let past progress make you complacent (sp?) and (2) Don't ignore the system in which you operate. It's great to send a message of hope that anybody can become anything; but if we don't recognize that the system is set up to make it a hell of a lot harder for certain types of people, then we're putting even more pressure on that group of people. A "tough upbringing" is exactly that - tough. And a "failure" to overcome is not solely the fault of that individual; it is also the fault of the system that set them up to fail.


How do you balance a message of hope, of telling young people "you can do anything you want" with the sober reality that there are still incredibly marginalized groups out there? How do you tell a young black man or woman "you can be anything", but be supportive of them if they don't reach that goal? And explain the forces that exist that have made their
> In all fairness to Obama, a college commencement address isn’t the place for a detailed policy speech, but it also shouldn’t be a place for this: “Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you’ve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured—and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too.” Because someone should care. And it would be nice if the president these young men were supposed to see themselves in cared. We make a grave mistake every time we invoke the history of oppression to diminish the reality of racism’s present. Progress is real, but the narrative of progress seduces us into inaction. If we believe, simply, that it gets better, there is no incentive to do the work to ensure that it does.

On how Obama's been treated:
> He did everything. He studied hard. He went to Harvard. He got married. He had children. He worked. He dreamed big. He pulled his bootstraps all the way up from his humble beginnings to the presidency. He lived the American Dream. And he was called an African witch doctor. People asked for his birth certificate. A congressman shouted at him “YOU LIE!” He faced the most recalcitrant Republican Congress ever that was elected by a constituency that wanted to “take the country back.” If a black man can be elected as guardian of the American empire, do exactly that, and still not be shielded from racism, what hope is supposed to be left?

## On mental health

> With a backlog of issues ranging from the War on Drugs to racist public education, depression seemed a low priority. I knew people who were locked up; I didn’t know anyone who was depressed. It was easy to forget.


> I thought no one I knew would have gotten close enough to a psychiatrist to be diagnosed. The only people I “knew” who had gone to a psychiatrist and would talk about it openly were white people in Woody Allen movies.

> they never express any concern about the trauma experienced by those left behind. In the rush to lock everyone away, the political class never stops to ask what kind of mental health care a community that deals with violence daily may need. Black people of all ages and genders are walking around with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and survivor’s guilt without anywhere to turn. We attempt to heal our broken insides with whatever is available. More often that not, what’s available are the most unhealthy options. We overdose on liquor and drugs, unprotected sex, violence, and repression because that’s all there is to help us cope. It’s important not to pathologize this kind of behavior as uniquely black, because everyone self-medicating an undiagnosed mental illness is susceptible, but at the same time we have to recognize that this is all that’s offered to black people in terms of help. So like every other social ill, our post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and survivor’s guilt takes a more dangerous turn when filtered through American racism.

> “I definitely want to thank my doctor, Dr. Santhi, my psychiatrist. . . .” I let out a very audible “oh shit” when he said that. “She really helped me relax a lot. Thank you so much. It’s so difficult to play, so much emotion going on in the playoffs, and she helped me relax. I knocked down that three, just like you told me.” This was one of the greatest sports moments of my lifetime. It was so meaningful to me that it became the subject of my first professional piece of writing. Ron Artest had opened a door.

## On music, comedy, and sports

> Kanye was also the first rapper whose in-rhyme biography I could relate to while still enjoying the music. The projects that produced Jay Z and Nas, the shootouts that produced 50 Cent and Game, the hustling that produced T.I. and Clipse, the dirty south that produced Outkast, the pimping that produced Snoop Dogg, and the white boy angst that produced Eminem didn’t reflect my suburban buppie-aspirant upbringing. And while my socially/politically conscious heroes—Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common, The Roots—stirred my rebellious mind, helping me make sense of the world and how it saw me, they rarely pushed me to look inward, to see myself. Kanye was able to locate the space in the middle of all of that, where sped-up soul samples, ego tripping, self-reflection, and indictments of racism coexisted in harmony, all from an ostensibly middle-class black perspective, while desperately seeking ’hood acceptance.

> But when an artist, especially one of Chappelle’s genius, is stripped down to a meaningless catchphrase, it’s an insult to their body of work. He was working hard to have his art respected in an industry that disposes of the talents of young black dudes without so much as brushing the dirt from its shoulders. Here he was being told that his worth wasn’t his intelligence or creativity, but his ability to mimic a famous person shouting obscenities. It was the popularity of the Rick James sketch that set him on the path toward South Africa. “The show is ruining my life”

> He wasn’t giving these sketches to the people who got it anymore. He was performing for people who wanted to shout “I’m Rick James, bitch!” at him on the street. People operating on that level could easily misconstrue his artistic intentions.


## On sexuality, masculinity

> Then later I learned what gay meant, and subsequently learned it wasn’t something you wanted to be. The playgrounds and basketball courts gave me the language. Anything and everything that was undesirable we called gay. The rules about when and how to take the ball out after a made shot were gay. The home base during tag was gay. Being assigned homework on the weekend was gay. The cafeteria not serving pizza was gay.


> “He seems like a nice guy, though,” my father said, as if he had previously considered being gay and a nice guy to be incompatible characteristics that might be able to coexist in Justin if he were gay. I staged another silent protest and left the room.


> I lived with two gay men, how could I be homophobic? I was uncomfortable with the word “faggot,” how could I be homophobic? I believed gay people should have the right to get married, how could I be homophobic? I’d watched Brokeback Mountain and didn’t turn away once, how could I be homophobic? One of the privileges of not being a part of a marginalized group is believing you can set your own benchmarks for bigotry.

> As an adult, knowing that’s a ridiculous fear to have, singing along to Frank Ocean pining after a man still felt “unnatural.” The fear was no longer there, but my tongue hadn’t caught up with my politics. I was relating to the sentiment behind the song “Forrest Gump,” but feeling my mouth fall flat trying to sing “you’re on my mind, boy.”


On racism as invisibility
> To believe this story—where Trayvon was the aggressor, a teenage boy more interested in fighting a stranger than getting back home to see if LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade could lead the Eastern Conference All-Stars in a comeback, that he brought Zimmerman close to death with his bare hands—is to believe the stories white supremacy has always told about black boys and men in America. You don’t need to hate black men in order to believe these stories. Black men’s humanity only need be invisible to you, so you never question where these stories came from and why they exist.

> In 1994, he told MTV, “We asked ten years ago. We was asking with the Panthers. We was asking with them, you know, with the Civil Rights movement, we was asking. Now those people that were asking, they’re all dead or in jail, so what do you think we’re gonna do? Ask?”

Here is a quote:
> Professor Foster’s approach to teaching English 101 was unorthodox. Whenever someone says something in education is “unorthodox,” it conjures images of a movie trailer about a nice white lady who goes to the inner city and teaches black youth that rap and poetry are really the same thing. But the norm is so staid that “unorthodox” as descriptor fits. It was “unorthodox” for us to engage with texts created by black authors. It was “unorthodox” for us to engage those texts not just for form, style, and prose but also content. It was “unorthodox” for us to be asked to relate the content to our current political moment. It was “unorthodox” for us to be expected to engage in classroom discussions about ideas where we would disagree with one another while the instructor refused to dictate but rather pushed us to think outside of our own experiences and perspectives. That should be a standard education. We call it “unorthodox.”

Here is a quote:
> But your heroes aren’t to be questioned because it makes the creation of your own mythology that much easier.

Here is a quote:
> Recognition is only a first step. Recognition is the easy part. The work of unlearning patriarchy requires an intense self-interrogation, which means getting beyond the self-congratulation and complacency of acknowledging patriarchy’s existence. It’s not just answering Toni Morrison’s question; it’s asking more questions of ourselves.





Here is a quote:
> He comes out of a school of thinking that may acknowledge the existence of racism, but sees it as the responsibility of black people to overcome, to achieve in the face of racism, not push for its end.

(emphasis my own)
> The most famous example of the application of this philosophy in black liberation activism is the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rosa Parks became an emblem of injustice not only by virtue of her exemplary courage, but because it would have been more difficult to rally support behind Claudette Colvin, the unwed pregnant teenager arrested for refusing to give up her seat nine months before Parks. <i>If part of the argument against racism were to rest on black people’s moral authority, the fifteen-year-old Colvin couldn’t become the face of the movement.</i>
