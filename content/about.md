Summary: About me

Hello! I'm a software engineer working on improving government services at [Nava](https://navapbc.com),
currently focused on [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov). Before Nava, I spent a number of
years at [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com), where I helped build the API used by Thumbtack's
native mobile apps, and built tools to help service professionals find customers that were most
relevant to them.

My interests include (a certain kind of) tech, government, social services, the criminal justice
system, using data to help inform decision-making, and data visualization.

You can find me [@nrjones8 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nrjones8) and [Github](https://github.com/nrjones8).
If you want to say hi, feel free to shoot me an email at nrjones8@gmail.com.

Since you're all dying to know about the name of this website, I've always used "nrjones8" - I
practically worshipped [Steven Gerrard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard) for many
years, which is where the "8" came from.
