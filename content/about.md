Summary: Information about this blog

Hello! I'm a Software Engineer working on improving government services at [Nava](https://navapbc.com),
currently focused on [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov). Before Nava, I spent a number of
years at [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com), where I helped build the API used by Thumbtack's
native mobile apps, and built tools to help service professionals find customers that were most
relevant to them.

My interests include (a certain kind of) tech, government, social services, the criminal justice
system, using data to help inform decision-making, and data visualization.

Some posts on this blog will be technical in nature, while others will not. If you'd like to follow
along with new posts, you can find me [@nrjones8 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nrjones8) and [Github](https://github.com/nrjones8).

If you want to say hi, ask questions, or provide any feedback, feel free to shoot me an email at
nrjones8@gmail.com.
