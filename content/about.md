Summary: Information about this blog

Hello! I'm a Software Engineer working on improving government services at [Nava](https://navapbc.com),
currently focused on [healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov). Before Nava, I spent a number of
years at [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com), where I helped build the API used by Thumbtack's
native mobile apps, and built tools to help service professionals find customers that were most
relevant to them.

My interests include (a certain kind of) tech, government, social services, the criminal justice
system, and how to responsibly use data in decision-making and writing.


## Non-technical writing
A lot of the writing on this website will be about topics that I'm not an expert in - I may have
read a few books and done some research, but they aren't my career area of expertise. I hope to use
this as a place to clarify my own thinking and understanding of such topics. Especially when
talking about areas that I'm less familiar in, I'll call out my assumptions and cite the material
that helped form my understanding.

## Contacting me

If you'd like to follow along with new posts, provide feedback on any of my writing, or otherwise

## Why "nrjones8"?
"Nick Jones" is a pretty generic name - turns out that "nickjones@gmail.com" was claimed long before
I ever tried to get it. The "8" originally came from a childhood idol, [Steven Gerrard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard).
