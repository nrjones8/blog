Summary: Who benefits from technological advances?

The world (and the USA) has a huge set of unresolved problems. [insert some problems here].
These problems affect different people in different ways (#firstworldproblems).
As a result, solutions to various problems improve the lives of those who had those
problems to begin with. 

* Problem: A CD player is huge, and I don't want to listen to the same music all the 
time. 
Solution: Here's an iPod! Now you've got [1000 songs in your pocket.](http://theipodrenaissance.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/the-ipod2.png)

* Problem: I want to keep in touch with my friends, see what they're doing with
their lives, and share what I'm doing. 
Solution: Facebook.

* Problem: My (insert device here) is hard to use, ugly, and clunky. I want something
better. 
Solution: Apple products.

* Problem: These potholes are really killing my car. I wish there were a way to report them!
(Partial) solution: build an app that [senses potholes](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679322/street-bump-a-smartphone-app-automatically-tells-the-city-when-you-drive-over-potholes)
and alerts the city government. 

* Problem: Americans need to sign up for healthcare online. 
Solution: [healthcare.gov](http://healhcare.gov) ...errr this is awkward.

Obviously, some of these problems are a bigger deal than others. Technology serves, in some 
sense, to solve some subset of these problems. As technology has improved over time,
the subset of "tech-solvable" problems has grown. A crowd-sourced automated pothole sensor 
wasn't possible before the rise of and availability of smart phones. But how has the
subset of "tech-solvable" problems changed over time? And who do these solutions serve?
Smart phones are an example of a hardware improvement, i.e. new devices which allow people
to do previously unthinkable things. In an era where [tech is no longer primarily technology
driven it is idea driven](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html?_r=0), 
what new ideas

-- Does that subset of problems unproportionally affect certain populations? In other words, do advances in tech really just perpetuate the gap in life quality?
