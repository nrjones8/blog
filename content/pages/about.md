Hello humans! I'm a Software Engineer interested in government, media, data visualization, and how to use data responsibly in decision-making and writing. In the past, I've worked on improving government services at [Nava](https://navapbc.com), and built tools to help local professionals grow their businesses at [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com).

## Projects

### Tracking California's prison overcrowding problem
[Since 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Plata), California has been under a court-mandated reduction of its prison population to 137.5% of its designed capatiy. In order to track progress of _individual_ prisons over time, I built a tool to parse [PDFs published monthly by the CDCR](https://sites.cdcr.ca.gov/research/population-reports/monthly-total-population-report-archive/) and aggregate monthly population data into one easily-analyzable CSV.

The data and code are [on Github](https://github.com/nrjones8/cdcr-population-data); I also [wrote about](https://nrjones8.me/measuring-prison-overcrowding.html) why the court's definition of "overcrowding" as an average across 35 prisons is extremely problematic, as many individual prisons have continued to house upwards of 160% of their designed capacities. After releasing the data, UC Hastings professor Hadar Aviram wrote a follow-up [blog post](http://californiacorrectionscrisis.blogspot.com/2018/01/are-ca-prisons-really-less-crowded.html) on the topic.

### Hourly News Homepage Archive
A project to archive what the front page of various news websites show. Screenshots are taken *every hour* starting January 1, 2019 and continually updated. In addition, I built an explorer UI to browse the screenshots over time. You can access [that tool here](https://nrjones8.github.io/news-archive-explorer/#/), and its code [on Github](https://github.com/nrjones8/news-archive-explorer).

For more infromation about accessing the screenshots directly, and the technical details of the screenshotter, you can find the code and description [on Github](https://github.com/nrjones8/website-screenshotter). In addition to the screenshot browsing app above, the screenshots have been used to inform stories [on Storybench](http://www.storybench.org/fox-news-obsession-with-aoc-crowded-out-2020-candidate-announcements/).

### MUNI fare inspectors on rainy days
Published [on Storybench](http://www.storybench.org/using-r-to-explore-the-relationship-between-san-francisco-muni-citations-and-the-weather/), an investigation into the relationship between bad weather and the number of citations handed out by MUNI. Using data obtained via records request from MUNI, I found an increased rate of citations on days that it rained vs. those when it didn't.

### Finding discriminatory job postings on ZipRecruiter
Online job boards are an increasingly common way for people to find jobs. How do platforms like ZipRecruiter and Indeed handle potentially discriminatory job postings? I [wrote about finding job postings](https://nrjones8.me/job-boards-eeoc-violations.html) that are potential EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) violations against people with criminal records, where companies include blanket exclusionary statements like "No Criminal Background" in their job descriptions - and described a dataset of potential violations on ZipRecruiter.
